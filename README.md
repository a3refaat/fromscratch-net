# FromScratch-Net ðŸ§ 

A fully functional deep learning framework implemented from scratch in NumPy â€” complete with forward propagation, backpropagation, batch training, weight initialization, and support for classification and regression tasks. Recent developments include hardware acceleration via Cupy integration, if available via model.to('cuda') - inspired by Pytorch. Although this is obviously not truly optimized at all. While this is still rudimentary and lacks utility when compared to state of the art libraries, I did my best to make it user friendly.

I plan to contribute to this architecture over time as a learning project. Long term goals involve support for image processing through convolutional layers, and eventually using this to build into transformer architectures.
